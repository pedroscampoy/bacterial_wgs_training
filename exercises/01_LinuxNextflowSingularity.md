#### How do I use the command line?

Open a terminal and type into it. Remember to use TAB to autocomplete and suggest commands, paths and files!

#### How do I navigate the file system?

Let's remember the basics: ***pwd cd ls mkdir mv rm rmdir less nano***. We are going to use those commands to:

Check our working directory: `pwd`

Move to our Desktop folder: `cd Desktop`

Create a directory called "myDir": `mkdir myDir`

Move to the new folder: `cd myDir`

Check our working directory: `pwd`

Create the folders "asdf", "AsDf", "ASDF" and "tmp": `mkdir asdf AsDf ASDF tmp`

Create a file inside "tmp" called "myFile.txt": `nano tmp/myFile.txt` and write whatever you want.

Rename "myFile.txt" to "whateverIwant": `mv tmp/myFile.txt whateverIwant`

See the contents of "whateverIwant": `less tmp/whateverIwant`

Remove the folders inside "myDir": `rmdir ./*`

Remove the file: `rm tmp/whateverIwant`

Go back to Desktop and remove everything you created: `cd ..; rm -rf tmp`

Return to your home directory: `cd`

#### How do I know which software I am using?

Software may (and will) be installed in many different places. To discover the one you have loaded in your PATH use `which`, to see all the places where the shell is looking for software check the variable `$PATH`, to know the version of the software use the apropiate parameter (`-h --help -v --version`) and to check the manual of the software use `man`.

```
which git
echo $PATH
git -h
git --version
man git
```

#### How do I use Nextflow with a Singularity image?

`nextflow`

So, what now? In order to execute a nextflow pipeline, we need to tell it to `run` a project which contains a `main.nf` script written in groovy + the pipeline languages:

`nextflow run /home/bioinfoadm/Documents/wgs/bacterial_wgs_training`

Optionally, we can pass a config file, and specify the .nf script inside a project:

`nextflow -C /home/bioinfoadm/Documents/wgs/bacterial_wgs_training/nextflow.config  run /home/bioinfoadm/Documents/wgs/bacterial_wgs_training/main.nf`

There is no need to download the software you want to execute, you can also execute a github repository:

`nextflow run BU-ISCIII/bacterial_wgs_training `

Finally, let's ask how to use the pipeline:

`nextflow run /home/bioinfoadm/Documents/wgs/bacterial_wgs_training --help`

There is one big detail left. The software needed to execute the pipeline is no installed in our machine. Thankfully, we have a singularity image (container) ready for this course, and our pipeline has already being configurated to know where to find it and how to use it. Use the right argument and go for it:

`nextflow run /home/bioinfoadm/Documents/wgs/bacterial_wgs_training -profile singularity`
